On Linux Mint, the default version of Firefox is installed and configured to allow the following search engines to be queried directly from the address bar:

- Yahoo!
- Startpage
- DuckDuckGo
- Wikipedia

Mint defines these as the default available set of search engines based upon 3 criteria (funding to Linux Mint, privacy support and whether the search engine is non-commercial).

Other search engines such as Google, Bing or Twitter, etc. can easily be added into the default version of Firefox however.

To add a different search provider, browse to [Search Engines](https://www.linuxmint.com/searchengines.php)

At the bottom of the page, click on the icon of the requested search engine, then click on the `...` button in the URL bar and select the `Add Search Engine` option.

You then have the option to change the default search engine within Firefox preferences to your new choice.
